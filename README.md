# Python Learning Roadmap

## Stage 1: Python Basics (1-2 weeks)
**Objective**: Get familiar with Python syntax and basic constructs.
- **Variables & Data Types**: `int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`
- **Basic Operators**: Arithmetic, comparison, logical
- **Control Flow**: `if`, `elif`, `else`
- **Loops**: `for`, `while`
- **Functions**: Define and call functions, `return`
- **Input/Output**: `input()`, `print()`
- **Error Handling**: `try`, `except`

### Example:
python
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")

Stage 2: Data Structures & Algorithms (2-4 weeks)

Objective: Learn essential data structures and algorithms.

    Lists & Arrays: Creating, accessing, modifying
    Tuples & Sets: Immutable sequences, unique elements
    Dictionaries: Key-value pairs
    Basic Algorithms:
        Searching: Linear Search, Binary Search
        Sorting: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort
    Stacks & Queues: Using lists for LIFO/FIFO operations

Example: Stack using list

python

class Stack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.items = []
    
    def push(self, item):
        self.items.append(item)
    
    def pop(self):
        return self.items.pop() if self.items else None

Stage 3: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) (2-3 weeks)

Objective: Master OOP concepts for structuring your Python code.

    Classes & Objects: class, __init__
    Encapsulation: Private and public attributes
    Inheritance: Reusing code with classes
    Polymorphism: Method overriding, dynamic behavior
    Methods & Attributes: Instance variables and methods

Example: Class and Object in Python

python

class Car:
    def __init__(self, make, model):
        self.make = make
        self.model = model

    def start_engine(self):
        print(f"{self.make} {self.model} is now running.")

Stage 4: Intermediate Python (3-4 weeks)

Objective: Deepen your understanding of Python and explore intermediate topics.

    List Comprehensions: Compact way to create lists
    Lambda Functions: Anonymous functions
    Decorators: Wrapping functions with added functionality
    File I/O: Reading from and writing to files
    Modules & Packages: Importing and creating modules

Example: List Comprehension

python

squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]
print(squares)

Stage 5: Advanced Python (4-6 weeks)

Objective: Master complex topics and prepare for real-world Python applications.

    Generators & Iterators: Efficient looping and lazy evaluation
    Concurrency: Using threading, asyncio for parallelism
    Regular Expressions: Searching and manipulating text
    Advanced Data Structures: Heaps, Tries, Graphs
    Dynamic Programming: Optimization through memoization and tabulation

Example: Generator

python

def count_up_to(max):
    count = 1
    while count <= max:
        yield count
        count += 1

Stage 6: Frameworks & Libraries (3-4 weeks)

Objective: Learn libraries and frameworks for specific applications.

    Web Development: Flask, Django
    Data Science: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
    Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras
    Automation: Selenium, BeautifulSoup (web scraping)

Stage 7: Projects & Practice (Ongoing)

Objective: Solidify your knowledge with real-world projects.

    Build projects like:
        To-Do List Application
        Web Scraper
        Simple Web App with Flask/Django
        Data Analysis Project with Pandas
    Contribute to open-source projects on GitHub.

Total Estimated Time: 3-6 months
